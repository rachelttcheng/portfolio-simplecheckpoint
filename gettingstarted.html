		<p>Ah, yes. The age old gym question: how do you actually motivate yourself to start going to the gym?</p>
		<p>And then the age old gym answer: Just go! Going to the gym consistently isn't just about motivation -- you need discipline as well.</p>
		<p>I'll admit that I don't wake up every day wanting to go to the gym. But I go anyways, and after I'm done with my session I'm always glad I had pushed myself to go.
			At the same time, be kind to yourself if you miss a day. Results don't happen overnight, but they also won't disappear overnight either!</p>
		
		<div class="smallerspacer"></div>

		<p>Here are some things I've found that help with motivating/disciplining me to go to the gym:</p>

		<div class="motivationpoint">
			<span class="motivationheader">1. Bring a friend</span>
			<p>Having a gym buddy keeps both of you in check with going to the gym. It's also great for moral
				support!

			<img src = "images/rachel_and_max.jpg" class="horizontalinline" alt = "post-workout picture of Rachel and Max"/>
		</div>
		
		<div class="motivationpoint">
			<span class="motivationheader">2. Wear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident</span>
			<p>Never underestimate the importance of wearing something you look and feel good in to the gym! I find that wearing a cute
				workout set makes me excited to go to the gym and do my thing. Whatever looking and feeling good means to you, pursue that!
				I currently wear a lot of things from Gymshark (not surprising).
				If you're lifting heavy, I would also recommend wearing some nice flat-soled, high top shoes on leg days, since
				these will help you stay more "connected" to the ground to stabilize your movements and support your ankles.
				I currently wear high-top Converse. Some other popular shoes currently are Nike Blazers and high-top Vans.

		<div class="motivationpoint">
			<span class="motivationheader">3. Set goals for yourself</span>
			<p>Set goals for yourself, and plan out what you're going to do at the gym before you go so you don't get anxious when you're there</p>

		<p>What do you do after a workout? Make sure you get your protein in.</p>
